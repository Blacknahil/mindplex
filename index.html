    <h1>Journey to Icog Labs</h1>
    <div class="container">
    <p>I applied for a quantum computing and software development position that Hope posted on her telegram channel. I was able to pass the resume screening and got interviewedâ€”and I passed! 
    Since then, I have been reading about quantum mechanics, quantum computing, and comparing algorithms on both classical and quantum computers theoretically. 
    But recently, we have moved on to working on experimentation on Dirac-3. I am mentored by Hope Alemayehu and work with other cool people desperate to know quantum computing.</p>
    
    <!-- <h3>My Weekly Tasks</h3> -->
    <p>Every Saturday, I work on various projects, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</li>
        <li>Metta Language</li>
        <li>Predictive Coding Networks</li>
        <li>Many others</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <p>Additionally, I am taking mathematical, quantum-related, and machine learning courses on Coursera to deepen my understanding.</p>
